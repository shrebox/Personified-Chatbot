To ensure this, naturally security and national defence are very important, which you are doing working for. Services are asking for various force multipliers such as missiles, electronic warfare systems, sonar?s, underwater systems etc., But most important contribution that you have to make is that, in future there will not be exclusive defence or commercial technology, there will be only one technology used for both with certain modifications. Particularly, BEL can play a very important role, in generation of big terrestrial solar power panel and high efficiency solar cells with using Gallium arsenide. I was told that 2 million cells phones are sold in the market every month, but they are all imported. Times has come for BEL and other institutions in India to start manufacturing the systems, subsystems and components and produce them indigenously.

What do you see as the most significant achievements of your rather distinguished career culminating in a Bharat Ratna in your lifetime? My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr Vikram Sarabhai of the department of space. Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him. And Dr Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear  material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the greatest opportunity of my life. I see four milestones in my career. One: The twenty years I  spent in Indian Space Research Organisation. I was given the opportunity to be the project director for India's first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3. The  one that launched Rohini. These years played a very important role in my life as a scientist.  Two: After my ISRO years, I joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation and got a chance to be part of India's guided missile programme. It was, you could call, my second bliss when Agni met its mission requirements in 1994. Three: The department of atomic energy and the DRDO had this tremendous partnership in the recent nuclear tests, on May 11 and 13. This was my third bliss. The joy of participating with my team in these nuclear tests and proving to the world that India can make it. That we are no longer a developing nation but one among them. It made me feel very proud as an  Indian. And, finally, four: The fact that we have now developed for Agni a re-entry structure, for  which we have developed this new material. A very light material called carbon-carbon. One day an orthopaedic surgeon from the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (in Hyderabad) visited my laboratory. He lifted the material and found it so light that he took me to his hospital and showed me his patients. There were these little girls and boys with heavy metallic callipers weighing over 3 kg each, dragging their feet around. He said to me: Please remove the pain of my patients. In three weeks, we made these Floor Reaction Orthosis 300 gram callipers and took them to the orthopaedic centre. The children could not believe their eyes! From dragging around a 3 kg load on their legs, they could now move around freely with these  300 gram callipers. They began running around! Their parents had tears in their eyes. That was my fourth bliss.", "What is your vision of India in the next millennium? I have three. Three visions for India. But before that I speak about them, I have one question to ask of you, Mr Nandy. Can you tell me why, in 3000 years of our history, people from all  over the world have come and invaded us, captured our land, conquered our minds? From Alexander onwards. The Greeks, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not invaded anyone. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because, I guess, we respected the freedom of others. Absolutely right. That is why my first vision is that of freedom. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build upon. If we are not free, no one will respect us. My second vision for India is development. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we saw ourselves as a developed nation. We are among the top five nations of the world in terms of GDP. We have a 10 per cent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self reliant and self assured. Tell me, Sir, is this right? Read the last chapter of my book, India 2020, A Vision for the Next Millennium and you will get what I mean. I have a third vision. That India must stand up to the world. I have written 12 chapters on that. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. In this world, fear has no place. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only  as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand in hand.", "Though there are many TV programmes that are informative about India's development in various fields how can we make them more interesting so that they reach all strata of society? Recently I went to a village called Keerapalayam. In that Panchayat at Cuddalore District of Tamil Nadu I found men and women using music, play and dance to promote hygienic needs like keeping the houses and surroundings clean. It was captivating. Similarly, we should promote our developmental programmes like PURA (Providing Urban facilities at Rural Areas) and other activities through poems, plays, dances, dramas etc. For example, Poet Mahakavi Subramania Bharathiyar wrote in 1910 a poem for dance called meaning: Let us sing and dance and rejoice That we have achieved freedom from foreign yoke He wrote this much before we achieved freedom in 1947. This song became very popular. Everywhere it used to be sung and inspire the masses to work for our freedom during our freedom struggle. Similarly, our development oriented song and dramas will help us in our mission of Vision 2020 and also inspire various strata of our society to work for it.", "According to you, what is 'Achievement'?

The concept of PURA \u2014 which stands for \u201cProviding Urban amenities in Rural Areas\u201d \u2014 is about giving a cluster of villages physical, electronic and knowledge connectivity. The idea is to empower the villagers, so that economic connectivity can emerge. We planned about 7,000 PURAs for the country \u2014 including hill PURAs, coastal PURAs and plains PURAs. I believe that connectivity is the key to bridging the rural-urban divide. The core-competence of the village will enable the production of competitive products for national and international markets. This will lead to rural enterprises which will create jobs in villages and lead to a vibrant economy in India\u2019s hinterland. That is how prosperity will emerge in the rural environment.", "That is a great story; thank you for sharing it. Continuing further with the six traits, the fourth trait is that the leader should have the courage to make decisions. Fifth, the leader should have nobility in management. Every action of the leader should be transparent. And finally, the leader should work with integrity and succeed with integrity. All the traits apply especially to the President of a country. The President continuously must be in touch with the people. The Rashtrapati Bhavan [i.e., the presidential residence in New Delhi, India\u2019s equivalent of the White House] must become the people\u2019s residence.

How will social grids \u2014 such as the knowledge grid, the health grid and e-governance grid \u2014 help make India a developed country? The idea is that the knowledge grid empowers the village citizens with skill and knowledge. The health grid brings the super-specialty healthcare that is available in the cities to the doorsteps of rural citizens. And the e-governance grid brings transparent governance to the citizens. All these grids lead to economic growth and social transformation.", "How can India become energy independent by 2030? Today fossil fuels dominate the energy sector throughout the world. The World Energy Forum predicts that in five to eight decades, the fossil fuels will run out because these sources of energy are not renewable. Also, energy costs will go up. Oil is already at $110 per barrel, and if this continues, this situation will be very tough to manage. So I set a goal of energy independence for my country. It\u2019s a three-dimensional approach. First, we should invest in solar power. Today solar power is not economical because the efficiency of solar cells is just 15% to 20%. So we should use CNT (carbon nano tubes) composites that can increase the efficiency of solar cells to 45% or 50%. Second, we should use nuclear energy, because India has abundant thorium based nuclear reactors. This is definitely a clean solution to energy needs. The third focus area should be bio-fuels, including ethanol as well as bio diesel made from jatropha [a plant that grows in wastelands] and algae. These three initiatives can free India from dependence on fossil fuels. It will also help maintain a clean environment.", "Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy.

Before becoming the President of India, I was working on the second vision for development of our nation using technology missions. This programme was evolved when I was the Chairman of TIFAC. I find, now I can put forth this programme before our Parliament and Government. This way I can market this programme. Besides, I was guiding students for Ph.D when I was a Professor. I am still continuing to do so. So, among the other tasks of the President of India, Science &amp; Technology and its applications are also involved.", "Sir, you have dealt with the human mind as a teacher and monitored a missile as a missile man. Which do you think is more difficult? I am always happy to be a teacher, since it gives me an opportunity to be with the young who are always curious. Their curiosity provides mutual benefit to the teacher and the taught. I have seen during teaching some students excel the teacher in the way of thinking in all respects. The teachers profession is very satisfying compared to any other task.", "Sir, What were your feelings when you became the Rashtrapati and whom did you remember at that time? The confidence reposed in me by the people really moved me.

What should be done to stop it? What can we children do to help stop corruption? Home generates enlightened citizens. If such an evolution does not take place, difficult situation arises as we are witnessing. Eradication of corruption in public life requires a movement and this movement has to start from home and school. Only three people can help in eradicating corruption. They are father, mother and primary school teacher. If they inculcate righteousness among the youth nobody can change them in their later life.

We all have passed the phase of youth. Basically, it all depends on family values, which are good in India. So there's a big hope. And regarding the possible problem with the young, it can be tackled by giving a big mission to them. First & foremost, you as a student should excel in academics. Second, over the weekend you can educate the 40% people who are illiterate, without disturbing your studies. Third is: environment is being damaged particularly in the urban areas. You can contribute by organising a \"young movement\" to conserve environment. You plant trees. Suppose you decide to plant 5 trees before you come out of IIT Kharagpur or Lady Shriram College, and each one of 500 million people plant two trees each, that would become 1 billion trees! The movement of the young always has the ability to excite. Apart from that, you must always have a dream - after economics, after B.A., what will I do? It should be clear: what I want to do in the next 10 years. Similarly, after Civil Engineering, will you become a designer, will you become a manager, a leader? Or as an economist would you become a good professor, or, would you like to contribute in the making of the economic design of our nation? Or, would you like to contribute nationally by participating in the planning of National Development?  Like that, you should have a dream.", "You were talking of the youth educating people.

With flowers, with fragrance, with birds flying, the deer and what not - everything's here. I spend a lot of time. The second thing: I meet 50 to 100 children from various parts of the country. Third thing, I have my scientific agenda and tasks. I'm guiding a scientist for Ph.D. which I was doing when I was in Anna University as a Professor. He was my student, so currently I'm guiding him even now. Yes, he wouldn't leave me! There's also a fourth thing. I have come here with a mission\u2014India should be transformed into a developed nation. And we are trying to talk to Parliament members, political leaders and legislatures, I'm trying to show we all can live in a developed nation.", "The prime minister said at the ASEAN meet that 54 per cent of India's population is now under 25. What do you feel about this, sir? Ours being a young nation... So, what do you feel about this, Sir, since we are getting into this groove of a young nation. Yes, its true, below 20 itself there are more than 200 million people. I believe it is our wealth. And just like in 1857, they were told to get freedom, and the young people were the first to jump into it. I believe that was the first vision of our nation. The second vision for the nation is transforming it into a developed nation. Out of a thousand, 260 people are below the poverty line. We have to lift them up. If the mission is injected into the minds of the young, then their minds will be ignited, they will transform India into a peaceful and prosperous country.", "Sir, you are the inspiration of millions, who was your inspiration? My inspiration? Prof Vikram Sarabhai, heard about him? Well, my earliest inspiration was my science teacher, Sivasubramania Iyer. This man taught me in fifth class, I was 10 then. He was teaching how a bird flies. He went to the blackboard, drew the bird, its tail, nose, beak and wings and started talking about how it flies. You know which year [it was]? 1941. You were not even ideas then. After 45 minutes, he asked how many of us understood. Many students raised their hands. There were 30 of us who did not. He said, \"Those who did not understand...come in the evening.\" Rameshwaram is a small island, with birds flying over the sea. He said, \"Just watch, the wings are flapping. Now, the tail lifts, the wings flap and the direction changes.\" Tell me, what propels a bird? Cars and aircraft have engines, what does a bird have? Yes, life! Life is what actuates the brain. That's how he would explain. In a few minutes we all understood how a bird flies. But that's not important - what is important is, from that day something got into me, the bird's flight! I was just 10 but the teacher was so good he made me dream.... Flight? Science? I knew in a definite sense, my future had to have something to do with flight. That is how I developed interest in maths and physics. After school, I did aeronautical engineering at Madras Institute of Technology. Then on to rocket engineering at ISRO. That's where my career started. My science teacher put me on this orbit, but the full shape was given by Prof Sarabhai. He was a visionary. It was the '60s. Back then, we had no rocket, no missile, nothing. He gave us a vision statement\u2014India should design and develop high-powered rockets, make communication satellites, remote-sensing satellites. That was his vision.", "Was he the one, your teacher initially, who inspired you to write Ignited Minds? No, Ignited Minds I wrote after meeting young people like you.", "With network now almost at every home, does class room education any more relevant than the distant education? Classroom teaching cannot be substituted by the distance education. Both are complementary. Teacher is vital up to secondary education. Tele-education can be used to enrich the content of education and higher education.", "How can we educate every child without improving their economic condition? Both have to go together.", "You began your career with ISRO. You were the Project Director of the first successful SLV-3 flight from Sriharikota, in July 1980. Then you joined the DRDO. Recently you took part in the activities of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) related to the five nuclear explosions at Pokhran in May. What are your experiences in each of these departments? When I worked at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, Rajan worked at the ISRO headquarters (Bangalore), and he also worked at the VSSC. We were in the Physical Research Laboratory also... I started my career in the VSSC and worked there for nearly 20 years - from 1962 to 1982. One of the major projects I was assigned then was to design, develop and build a satellite launch vehicle called SLV-3 to put the Rohini satellite into low earth orbit. This was India's first satellite. I had a fantastic team. It was called the SLV-3 team, and many technology groups at the VSSC, at the Sriharikota (SHAR) centre and the ISRO Satellite Centre (Bangalore) were all partners in this great mission. What we learnt when I put the satellite successfully into orbit in July 1980 was that in any task we do, the mission is greater than the individuals and organisations. That brought together many partners from research and development organisations, industries and various laboratories. This was one of the major experiences. This continued with me wherever I went. In 1982, when I joined the DRDO, one of the major programmes we evolved was the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. This programme, comprising many missiles, came out of the intensive partnership between the DRDO laboratories - the prime laboratory at that time was the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation), and its Research Centre at Imarat, Hyderabad - and the defence industries, the armed forces and public and private sector industries. So, one is (the fact that the) mission (is) greater (than the individuals). Another is partnership. In both ISRO and the DRDO, when I was working there, thousands of engineers, scientists and staff (members) participated. Now the recent effort - a major mission that has been accomplished with the partnership of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), the DRDO and the Army - was the completion of five underground nuclear tests. I would attribute the success of this mission, as my friend Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, put it, to the \"synergy\" between the DAE and the DRDO. This has brought about a very important technological breakthrough. So the net result is the (joint) experience of three major scientific departments - ISRO, the DRDO and the DAE. India has the best of minds, creative minds. Any mission dreamt of can be accomplished.", "How did you feel when you realized that you didn\u2019t have to support your family with your newspaper route anymore? See, I firmly believe that the nation has to be bigger than the individual and the individual has to work for the nation. If you\u2019re working for yourself, you\u2019ll not be transparent. But once you put the nation above you, you become transparent.", "What is of vital importance - Personal development or national development? In what way does personal development contribute to national development? National development has to be achieved through people. Hence, development of people is very important. We have to create a personal development programme which will generate enlightened citizens who in turn will contribute towards national development.", "Sir, please quote the incidents / inspirations that have helped you to mould your career as the First Citizens of India? My career has been moulded by my primary teacher, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Vikram Sarabhai which spanned around 41 years. During that period as a scientist and technologist I worked with many teams in the development of satellite launch vehicles, missiles, nuclear test and generation of a road map for transforming India into a developed nation. Finally, an opportunity has been provided to me to market this idea to the nation.", "If everyone is educated who will perform the so called low and menial jobs such as sweepers, dhobis and so on.

The people who have a dream and worked hard and didn't deviate from the aim have all succeed.", "Dr. Kalam, you say the nation comes before the individual. What is your take on American business owners who have outsourced the jobs of their countrymen? Every nation has to follow a certain policy: Commercial, trade, various other types of policies. The phenomenon of globalization is going on. If you consider the law of development, there are two types of nations. One category holds the developed nations, numbering less than 10, and the second category holds the hundreds of developing nations. Developed nations produce and market products in their own country and throughout the world. Only then can they survive as developed nations. Developing nations want to become developed nations. So, they have to produce products and competitively market them globally. So what is the commonality in the picture? Competitiveness! That is a key concept. Cost, quality, marketing \u2014 all make up factors of competitiveness. So, all nations have to work competitively, all nations have to depend on each other, work together. There\u2019s nothing wrong in it.", "Sir, one last word to our readers. They must think in a big way. I remember 2000 years back, there is a famous saying in Thirukural by Saint Poet Thiruvalluvar \u2014 Vellathanaythu Malar Neetam Mandartham Ullathanaytu Uyarvu. It means that, just like the height of the water in a pond determines the height to which a lily would grow, it is the heights of thoughts that determines the heights to which you could aspire for. So as human beings they should have great thoughts, great aims, and when thoughts become transformed into actions performed with perseverance and devotion, success has to follow. Thank you very much sir.", "Sir, how do we, at Careers360 add better value for our readers? You should not become just like any other magazine. You see 700 million people are living in the rural area, you are reporting about 300 million people. So you should report the success story of a fisherman, an agrofood processor, a farmer, a craftsman. The message is become the magazine of a billion people population.", "Sir, would you then say, that it finally boils down to focusing on one mission in life? No, it is finally that the goal should be in front of you. That is my experience. We are always tempted to do many things simultaneously. But if you start doing one thing, have one goal and put all your efforts into that, then definitely you will succeed. Of course, you have to win! A problem always appears here and there but you have to face the problem and defeat the problem.", "And who taught you this message? Myself. I had to learn this myself. Literature also influenced me deeply. In India, we have a famous book called, Thirukkul, written 2,200 years back. I\u2019ll quote a couplet: \u201cIf your thoughts are high, definitely you\u2019re going to work for your aim, definitely you will succeed. But conversely, if you don\u2019t have an aim, don\u2019t have high thoughts, how can you aim at success?\u201d My second favorite book is Light From Many Lamps, by (Lillian Eichler) Watson. And the third book that I love is Empire of the Mind. These three books have made my life.", "What was your immediate reaction when \u201cAgni\u201d and \u201cPrithvi\u201d missiles were successful? I was right there and witnessed the whole thing. Courage is key. My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young people.", "You\u2019ve been called the \u201cMissile Man of India\u201d and the \u201cPeople\u2019s President.\u201d Is there an incongruity between your desire to empower the world with peace and making India a nuclear power? I am innocent to the whole affair! I did not call myself these names! (laughs). When a nation is surrounded by weaponized nations, she has to equip herself. That\u2019s what India has done. To make the nation peaceful and prosperous, we need minimum security. That\u2019s what we have done.", "How do you envision the epic communal divide between Muslims and Hindus bridged in India? Let me tell you a story. The Europeans fought with each other for hundreds of years. They even created two world wars. But today, we see that these same 23 nations have created the European Union. There are rich, not so rich, and poor nations in the EU, and all of them are working towards making Europeans live prosperous, happy lives. So, in India also such changes will happen, in fact throughout the whole world \u2014 the earlier the better. To give another example, U.S.A. and U.S.S.R., during the Cold War, generated 10,000 nuclear warheads. Today they are friends. They are saying they are working for world peace, they say they will bring down the number of nuclear warheads. So, historically, this cycle has to come to India too. Good things will happen.", "Sir i would like to ask whom do you admire the most in this world? What are the secrets of your success? Were you a naughty child during your school days? I will hope you will answer my simple questions please answer them!!! Of course my parents, I always remember my teacher who gave me the vision for my life while teaching how the birds fly.

We do not have enough uranium sources of our own. But we are not dependent on just one nation, we have sources from others also.", "While India has produced many eminent scientists why is it that we have not produced a single Gold Medallist at the Olympics? In my opinion there are two ways we can achieve this. The first is to identify talent at a young age and then develop the talent over a lifetime.

Keeping this in mind, I would like to know how, in your opinion, Sir, students of literature and the arts can help to take India forward? Prosperity of any nation depends directly on the creativity of its artists and writer. You will remember in your history books, you will always come across the fact that during the golden periods of any empire there were more artists and writers supported by the kings and courts. I believe that the students of arts and literature will be critical and important contributors to taking India as a developed nation and sustaining it there. Creative entertainment and management are likely to be areas where the future society is going to spend enormous amount of time and money. The students of art and literature can find ample opportunities in this arena to good jobs. They can also act as a very effective interface between the people and the policy makers as well as between the people and the scientist and technologists.", "Every child is a scientist.

What are the important lessons for managing an R &amp; D Unit? What are the pitfalls? For success in research and development we should have an organizational policy of promoting scientific temper among the scientist, openness of communication, tolerance to criticism, team work, collective problem solving and continuous improvement in performance. The organizational practice should be flexible, change with time and promote thinking and creativity. Reward system must be based on critical evaluation of performance and merit and the culture should nurture the feeling that nothing in science and technology is impossible.", "Sir, in these days when life is viewed as a rats' race by several people, why don't you try to include philosophy (comprising ethical values, spiritual laws of success, etc) as a core subject right from schooling to higher education, along with languages? The education between the age of five to seventeen is very important phase in character building among the children. This foundation is to be made by the parents and teachers. During this period I have suggested inclusion of one hour class every week on ?elevating the human minds.?

We know that about three fourth part of our earth is covered with ocean having abundance of water but that cannot be used for drinking purpose. My question is that can we devise a mechanism to convert ocean water into drinking water at reasonable cost and in large amount? The desalination of sea water can be achieved either through Reverse Osmasis or through Flash Evaporation. The cost of converting seawater into potable water has been coming down in the last two decades. In rupee terms, in 1980 it was Rs. 125 per thousand liter, in 1990 it became Rs. 75 per thousand liter and in 2000 it has come down to Rs. 50 per thousand liter. In 2004 in Israel the cost has come down to Rs. 25 per thousand liter. India is working on converting sea water into potable water. In the near future, use of solar energy is expected to bring down the cost of desalination further.", "What are your suggestions to meet unemployment problem in India?

How can this be achieved in the background of the tension, hostility and border incursions? I remember in April 2007, I addressed the European Parliament. There were around 800 parliament members from 23 nations. I told them when I see you all -- for hundreds of years you were fighting each other and you generated two World Wars, so a billion Indian people congratulate you. Forgetting all your wars, forgetting the difference of society, you formed a European Union for prosperity and peace. This should be an example. I had composed a poem and recited it there. They gave a standing ovation. That is not the issue, the issue is that such nations that created World War I and II, when they came together, we -- China and India -- are a people of great civilisation, in spite of all the differences, there are some great philosophy that is common. Buddha and Confucius are common to us. I believe we have to have a great mission. I suggested when the Chinese president came here that we have a World Knowledge Platform. I teach at the University of Beijing, I told them the time has come that both nations should combine our core competence, our 60 billion dollar business, should become 250 billion dollars. The border issue we should sort out once for all. People of the European Union fought for hundreds of years, a people who generated two World Wars and Hitler and lost millions of people are a union today for economic growth and peace and it happened in front of our eyes. So for me the differences between nations can be solved by mutual discussions. Both sides should decide what we can give and what we cannot. It should be an intensive one month discussion with experts and we should sort it out. I hope the present governments in India and China will do that.", "\u201cmmmmm errr, Sir, shall I, no, shall we\u2026..\u201d \u201cLady, if I would have been married in my young days, I would surely have had a daughter of your age.

Also any particle having rest mass equal to zero can attain the velocity of light. According to Einstein mass of particle increase with increase in velocity. Since when photon strikes anything it behaves as particle. Why then its mass is not infinite at that time as its velocity is equal to the velocity of light? Though physicists say that photons are massless, it is possible to assign a \"relativistic mass\" to a photon which depends upon its wavelength. This ?relativistic mass? can not be infinite. Due to finite wavelength the mass of the photon is finite even at the velocity of light.", "Who has been your inspiration and why? My parents inspired me with nobility as a human trait.

I still remember Prof. Satish Dhawan, he gave me a project in 1973, were you born then? I was born in 1973.(A burst of laughter) He gave me the SLV project in 1973, and named me the project director. I found that there were a lot of senior people above me, you know, experienced people, they should support me and there were a number of youngsters with high technical knowledge. So, I had to bring them all together to succeed. At that time I was in my thirties, 39 or 40. So, I was frightened, whether I can do it. It\u2019s a great job, how can I do it for the first time, how to build a rocket, to make a satellite, and it\u2019s a big vision and how can I do it?", "And the nation\u2019s expectations were on you? A lot of expectation. So then Prof.Satish Dhawan, the chairman saw my hesitation. He called me and gave me some advice, famous advice. He said, \u201cKalam, if you don\u2019t do any work, you don\u2019t experience any problem.\u201d Even in media, if you don\u2019t report there is no problem. If you report, problem starts. (He laughs heartily at this). So, Prof. Dhawan said major programmes are always coupled with major problems. But don\u2019t allow problems to become your captain, you should become the captain of the problem. Defeat the problem and succeed. This advice he gave me in 1973, even now it\u2019s true. It is true for politicians, educationists, media people, it\u2019s true in every area. So, the message I\u2019m giving is we should take control of the problems, okay?", "Sir, why do we find 2/3 of India\u2019s engineering graduates unemployable? What do you think is the underlying problem? During my recent visit to CanadaI visited a university called Waterloo. For an engineering degree students are taught in the classroom for one year, the next year they go to the industry. So two out of four years they spend in the industry. And in the industry they learn to work within the system, it may be the software system or the hardware system, machine system, electronic system, or chemical system. But they learn to apply what they studied at the university. So when they graduate there is good demand for them. They can hit the ground running.", "So, it is lack of integration between real-life work and academia that is the problem? I want to share with you my own experience. In 1957 I studied aeronautical engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. It was a difficult discipline to get into and we were only nine students. Now, Prof. Srinivasan gave us a six months project in our final year. The project was to design low-level (low altitude, he clarifies) attack fighter aircraft. So, having studied, aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, control, etc., here we have to put them together into a workable aircraft system design. I was the project leader for that. I was the ninth, so eight other people are there, someone would give propulsion, some other aerodynamics etc. So, after four and-a-half-months of study, I was there in my laboratory. The teacher, my guide comes. At that time we did not have computers, I was using the design board for drawing the design of the aircraft and my friends were all around me. So, he comes and sees and says, \u201cI\u2019m completely disappointed with your work; I am going to stop your scholarship if you don\u2019t complete the design in two weeks time.\u201d (Dr Kalam laughs.) It was a very costly education, if my scholarship stopped, I had to return home. I talked all kinds of things, gave him excuses, told him we had worked so hard, all of us are suffering etc. But to no avail. And so, finally all of us joined together day and night, Saturdays, Sundays; we didn\u2019t even go to our hostels. And we designed the fighter aircraft.On a Sunday evening Prof. Srinivasan came, exactly one day before the deadline. He saw the design, he was very happy. Then, he gave us Madras coffee in his house. (Dr. Kalam laughs again as he remembers). It taught me the value of planning, of teamwork, of time. But what we learned most out of that is that in the education system, while we study mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering etc. we should also have a clear understanding of how it all fits into a larger system, a productive system. So students must also be taught system design, system integration, system management, since that is what the industry wants. Our educational system should promote that.", "rom your several achievements, which one do you feel most happy and proud of? What makes the student perfect?

What makes one follow one\u2019s own dreams? Parents, access or commitment? Dreams are finally nothing but goals or mission in life. In my case I had great teachers in various phases of life. And also my parents, my father and mother were very useful teachers to me throughout their lives. I was the only fellow in the family studying, and their commitment to me was absolute. The spiritual environment at home shaped me.You should convert your goals and mission to success in spite of problems. That is my lifelong commitment.", "Sir, what is more important, the ability to handle failure or the ability to respond to failures? Of course, I have myself gone through many successes and a few failures. And I have also met a number of successful people throughout the world wherever I have gone, and when I discuss with them, they reveal how many problems they have encountered, what kind of failures they have had.", "Why, sir, is entrepreneurship and skill development very important to you? A. We add seven million people every year at 10+2 level and three million graduates every year. So, we inject ten million people into the society every year as employment seekers. This is because entrepreneurship is not taught, either in the secondary school education or in higher education or university education. Entrepreneurship is not part of the curriculum, neither is acquisition of usable skills. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying if 30 per cent people have to procure their skills, that training should be started during the period of education itself.", "Sir, what would be three qualities which you think one requires for success in life? I will say four qualities, okay. Number one, a clear aim in life, without it you will be going in all directions. Second, you should acquire the knowledge. You acquire knowledge in multiple ways.

Making missiles and rockets was my work in one of my earlier assignments. Our young generation has indeed an important role to play in making India a developed nation. The younger generation can help by concentrating on their studies and excelling in them. Also in your spare time, say on the weekends you can teach five people in the surrounding rural areas like villages to read and write. You can also plant five saplings in and around your home or in your school and take care of them.", "What is the future goal of your life? Seeing the smiles in the face of billion people.", "Recently, an arrest warrant was issued against you. After seeing all this, do you think that a common man can get justice in this atmosphere, when a warrant can be bought even against the highest authority of India? Dear Swati, Thanks for your mail. There is nothing wrong if police inquiry is initiated in my name on account of any of my action. One should not feel bad giving his explanation to police. However, if a warrant is issued to the President of India with designation, due to legality, questions arise. Aberrations and the exceptions never become the general rule. Whenever a person is aiming for a big goal and works hard for it, there will always be troubles or problems here and there. But one should not get disturbed with problems rather he/she should master the problem and defeat the problem to succeed.", "Do you think technology can facilitate removal of inequality? Yes.", "In many of the Hydroelectric projects carried out in the North East India faces water scarcity at the time of completion of it ? Again River inter-linking is a very big project.

It shall be an important infrastructure project for our young people.", "So you are confident by 2022, that we may be able to do it? We can do it, provided we have a national vision.", "Do we have that national vision? From 1930 to 1947, we wanted Freedom. Our caste system vanished, our religions vanished, our differences vanished and we were fighting only for Independence. I call that the first mission that India had. The second vision: Economic development. If you work like that and declare that mission in Parliament and people and government work for it, irrespective of whichever party they belong to, it is possible.

But you continue to move ahead with mission after mission. That is life.", "As one of the co-founders of India's space programme, you must be very proud of our Mars achievement. But at the same time when you say that we have to lift the large masses that remain poor, should not basic needs like healthcare, education, infrastructure precede loftier goals or at least go hand in hand? The space programme is targeted at uplifting the people. In geosynchronised orbit, more than 200 transponders are communicating to the Indian earth station. These transponders transmit communication, weather reports, 24 hour TV broadcast, the path of cyclones. All the recent major cyclones have been forecast by various satellites. 90 per cent of the space programme is for remote sensing and communication. You can remote sense what is the kind of wealth we have on earth like water, minerals etc -- so it is intended for the people. 90 per cent of the space programme is intended for the people. It is a people's programme. You asked about the Moon and Mars programme. We are spending less than 10 per cent of our space programme for finding and research on Moon and Mars so that we are partners in the research and no one can claim that it belongs to them. I don't want to see Moon and Mars as the property of some other nation. It should be international property. Ours is the lowest cost of going to the Moon or Mars and we found trace of water also on the moon. From Mars we don't know... some revolutionary ideas will come from our Mars programme.", "What kind of a leader was Vikram Sarabhai, the founder of India's Space programme?

He was a visionary. In 1970 he gave a report about what the nation's space programme should be for the next 20 years.", "In your book, you say 'The orientation must turn from the past to the future and focus on how India can become a developed nation. The real issue is that we are not to see ourselves as a nation and because of that there is no national vision.' Why do you think we have not been able to see ourselves as a nation? When we see the types of conflicts all around -- religious conflict, caste system, language problems -- any big nation will have such types of problems but the nation can be united for a big cause. Independence was a big cause that united us. That's why I am pushing this idea that the tool for India Vision 2020 is Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas. This way we can enhance village development. I have talked about all this in my book.", "Independence was a common goal that united people, but some would say that India today is more divided than what it was then. Any nation goes through a number of problems in various decades, but India has the experience of bringing together people on a big cause. I am a believer. The second great movement that India needs is India 2020 Vision and this will make people come together. Plus if the economic programme grows, the poverty level will come down. Only a national vision can lift 300 million -- that's one third of the population -- below the poverty line out of poverty.", "Sir, We know you are a music lover.

If that is improved and if there is a mechanism to reach the ordinary people, then we can do wonders in agriculture also; I think we have to go for food processing to sell the agriculture products, so that those products will sell for good price. But there is no right mechanism, which can tell the about the advances and techniques. Recently we have adapted Sprinkler irrigation for onion crop in our field, which gave good onion yield, the main point I want tell you is if possible from your president position if you can suggest some methodologies to improve this condition, it will be very good to improve the rural economy of India. Recently I have come across a model for productivity improvement in cotton followed by Oswal Group in a village called Navapind in Punjab. They have succeeded in doubling the seed cotton productivity of the entire village through a training programme conducted by the Punjab Agricultural University, Industry and Farmers.

My view is the following for the last 3000 years India has been invaded by many countries. Alaxander invaded India then British ruled, French had the colony, dutch had the colony, portugese had set up colony. Why? India needs peace for its progress. When all around the nation countires have nuclear weapons India cannot sit and do tapas. Strength respects strength. Whatever we have done in defence is only to defend our freedom.

Scientists believe that may be even the existence of universe is possible within the black hole. Using an adaptation of Einstein?s general theory of relativity, Nikodem Poplawski, of Indiana University, Bloomington, analysed the theoretical motion of particles entering a black hole. He concluded that it was possible for a whole new universe to exist inside every black hole, which could mean that our own universe could be inside a black hole as well.

We are finding it very time consuming and expensive to get river flow data, rainfall data and satellite images of different resolutions and time scales of our country. can you make the data freely available for research purposes so that we can do good work on them. the USA data is freely available in the net. But for our country it is very difficult. Why? The National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), an autonomous society under Department of Space disseminates the satellite remote sensing data to the user community, with data prices fixed to just to break even and retrieve the cost of investment, as expected of any autonomous body. The satellite data prices from NRSA are far lower than the international prices of satellite data. It should be noted that those data sets, which are available freely over the web, are of coarser resolutions and are mainly meant for environmental pplications. NRSA also provided such datasets (MSMR data from Oceansat 1) freely to registered users. NRSA provides the higher resolution satellite images data at a concessional rate to the academia at 50% of the actual prices, and for old archived data a further reduction of 50% is allowed, hence making the data available at 25% of the actual price. Yet another important scheme operated by Department of Space is to support the Universities / academic institutions through specific projects under the RESPOND, wherein total funding is provided for data and Research Fellows. Normally, the data cost will be in the range of 5-10% of the total project cost. There are currently several projects being carried out at many universities and research institutions under the RESPOND scheme. Regarding the specific query on the rainfall and river stream flow information, it should be noted we do not have an operational satellite based information services for the above purpose. May be, the agencies like India Meteorological Department (IMD), Central Water Commission (CWC) and National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) could provide further information on this, as they will have the above information generated as part of their mandate. For example, CWC operates a national network of hydrological observation stations, providing information on rainfall, riverflow and water quality. IMD provides in their website, daily meteorological observations from their network of stations. From the satellite side, internationally, the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) provides on an experimental basis the rain rate information using an onboard Precipitation radar, which has been used by many scientists in the country. There are techniques adopted by the scientists to derive the rain information from both passive and active microwave sensors. ISRO is planning for a joint mission with French Space agency, CNES, a mission known as Megha Tropiques Mission, which has the objective of providing more frequent, operational observations on the energy and water cycle including rainfall over the tropics. ISRO is also planning to set up a data centre with the intention of providing information more freely for research applications. Further, you may also be aware that ISRO has a Space technology Cell at IISC and we provide all support to the Departments there including the satellite data.

What we achieved was very close to what we had predicted. The measuring of the nuclear yield depends on multiple parameters--the location and number of instruments, the geology of the area, the location of the seismic station in relation to the test site. The New Scientist took data from 125 seismic stations and their analysis closely matches ours. We measured it at 5.4 on the Richter scale, which is equivalent to a yield of 58 kilotons, plus or minus five kilotons. The New Scientist estimate is nearer 60 kilotons.

After their tests, other countries produced 20,000 weapons of 70 different types. India's requirement is minimum deterrence. How many types of weapons we need decides how many tests we conduct.

There is a view that the quality of Indian graduates is not good enough for them to be employable. What are your thoughts on this view? As we are in the ascending economic trajectory, we are concerned about rising unemployment and illiteracy. Unemployment is not the major problem; the question of un-employability is a bigger crisis. According to the India Labour Report 2007, 53% of employed youth suffer some degree of skill deprivation while only 8 per cent of youth are unemployed. The remaining 47 per cent of India's youth suffer some degree of unemployablity. Only 7 per cent of the population in the 15 to 29 age group has received some form of vocational training. 300 million youth will enter the labour force by 2025. The unfinished product from the education system makes it vulnerable and creates social instability and inequality. The skill deficit among our youth is the most important issue to be addressed on priority. Recently, I went to meet the members of the Communication and Progress (CAP) Foundation at Hyderabad which is addressing this problem in its own unique way. We need many institutions like CAP to work on mission mode to make every Indian youth fully employable and an active contributor to national development missions. A similar system is required for enhancing the employability quotient of our university graduates.", "2020, when you had said India will become a developed nation, is now not very far away.

You helped launch several successful missiles, which led to your getting the nickname, \u201cMissile Man.\u201d What challenges were involved in getting this program going and leading it successfully? I worked for ISRO for about 20 years. My team and I worked to put India\u2019s first satellite into space. Then our team took up the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. These were youthful teams that worked with me, and they have gone on to take up much larger projects. These in turn have led to great value addition in areas such as technology, infrastructure and, above all, human resources. One of the important lessons I learned in the space and missile program was not just how to handle success but how to deal with failure. Wharton is in the management environment. I would like young people to understand how they should manage failure. In any project you take up, you will face problems. These problems should not become the captain of the project chief; the project chief should be the captain of the problems and defeat the problems.", "Could you give an example, from your own experience, of how leaders should manage failure? Let me tell you about my experience. In 1973 I became the project director of India\u2019s satellite launch vehicle program, commonly called the SLV-3. Our goal was to put India\u2019s \u201cRohini\u201d satellite into orbit by 1980. I was given funds and human resources \u2014 but was told clearly that by 1980 we had to launch the satellite into space. Thousands of people worked together in scientific and technical teams towards that goal. By 1979 \u2014 I think the month was August \u2014 we thought we were ready. As the project director, I went to the control center for the launch. At four minutes before the satellite launch, the computer began to go through the checklist of items that needed to be checked. One minute later, the computer program put the launch on hold; the display showed that some control components were not in order. My experts \u2014 I had four or five of them with me \u2014 told me not to worry; they had done their calculations and there was enough reserve fuel. So I bypassed the computer, switched to manual mode, and launched the rocket. In the first stage, everything worked fine. In the second stage, a problem developed. Instead of the satellite going into orbit, the whole rocket system plunged into the Bay of Bengal. It was a big failure. That day, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, Prof. Satish Dhawan, had called a press conference. The launch was at 7:00 am, and the press conference \u2014 where journalists from around the world were present \u2014 was at 7:45 am at ISRO\u2019s satellite launch range in Sriharikota [in Andhra Pradesh in southern India]. Prof. Dhawan, the leader of the organization, conducted the press conference himself. He took responsibility for the failure \u2014 he said that the team had worked very hard, but that it needed more technological support. He assured the media that in another year, the team would definitely succeed. Now, I was the project director, and it was my failure, but instead, he took responsibility for the failure as chairman of the organization. The next year, in July 1980, we tried again to launch the satellite \u2014 and this time we succeeded. The whole nation was jubilant. Again, there was a press conference. Prof. Dhawan called me aside and told me, \u201cYou conduct the press conference today.\u201d I learned a very important lesson that day. When failure occurred, the leader of the organization owned that failure. When success came, he gave it to his team. The best management lesson I have learned did not come to me from reading a book; it came from that experience.", "The environment is changing rapidly like global warning, deficit of water and crops are almost susceptible for this.

Did you ever think then or later that you could someday become the President of India? Please share with our viewers your rise to the highest office in the nation; how did this all come about? \u201cWell, that dream was not there, not at all. My younger age dream was to fly, as inspired by my primary school teacher, Subramaniam Iyer. One day, he taught us how a bird flies. The way he taught us how a bird flies led me to want something to do with flight. Of course, he injected in me an ambition that I must fly in life. After my aeronautical degree, it was a disappointment that I was not selected by the Air Force. But then, I was fortunate that the space program got started by the visionary Dr. Vikram Sarabai then, and I was entrusted with the project for the design and development of the first satellite launch vehicle for the country. That led me to my initiation into integrated missile development program. Both these programs gave me an insight on putting technology and people in the organization together for realization of complex missions. I was also getting exposed to some societal needs, particularly through integration of medical and engineering disciplines. Then came the exciting experience of evolving India mission 2020 with the help of a great team. That led me to my lifetime passion of interacting with the youth. I took up a teaching assignment at Anna University on Technology for Societal Transformations. At that time, the nation offered me the opportunity of serving as the President of India.

In this respect we should learn from our Upanishads which says ?Neti, Neti? meaning that it is not the answer. Through this process the individual will be forced to make continuous search for the right answer. We have to promote entrepreneurship among students which means he should be able to take well considered calculated risk. This will promote creativity among the entrepreneurs.

I would suggest that we draw lessons from this unfortunate incident of Kumbakonam and try to build in certain safety features in our school buildings without which it should not be possible to accord affiliation to these schools.

How does a good leader defeat the defeat? I tell you about an experience of your life. In 1973, I was made the head of India's satellite launch program, also called SLV-3. Abdul Kalam Motivational Experience in Hindi www.officialkalam.com Our goal was to send our satellite 'Rohini' to space in any way until the 1980s. For which I was given a huge budget. And human resources were also provided. But I was also convinced that we have to fulfill this goal for a certain time. Thousands of people worked very hard Until 1979 - maybe August was the month - we thought we are now fully prepared. Being a project director on the launch day. I went to press the launch button in the control room. 4 minutes before launch, the computer started checking the list of things that were necessary. So that there is no shortage And then after some time the computer stopped the launch. He was telling that some things are not at the correct position as per the requirement. There were some experts as well as me. They assured me that everything is fine. And there are no mistakes. And then I bypass the instructions of the computer. And started the rocket. Everything was fine till the first stage. But the second stage got messed up. Instead of going into space rockets dropped into Bay of Bengal. It was a very big failure. On the same day, Chairman of Indian Space Research Organization (I.S.R.O.) Prof. Satish Dhawan called a press conference Prof. Dhawan, who was head of the institution. He took all responsibility for the mission's failure. And said that we needed some more technological measures. Media of the whole country was present there. He said that this work will be completed by next year. In the next year, July 1980, we tried again. And this time we have succeeded. The whole country was feeling proud. This press conference was also convened this time. Professor Dhawan called me in the side and said - \"This time you do press conference.\" On that day I learned a very important thing. When a failure comes, a leader takes full responsibility. And when he succeeds, he shares it with his peers.", "One last question \u2014 you are a gifted poet.

Is there anything you wanted to accomplish that you were unable to do? Last year I came up with an idea: I felt I should power the Rashtrapati Bhavan completely with solar power.

Before I could answer them, my term ended. I would have liked the Rashtrapati Bhavan to be the first home in India to be powered completely by solar energy.", "During your years as India\u2019s president, what was the biggest leadership challenge that you faced and how did you overcome it? I returned the Office of Profit Bill to the Parliament. The reason was that I felt there was no transparent system for determining whether a post was an office of profit. That was a major decision. I studied the bill and returned it to the parliament for reconsideration.

How will social grids \u2014 such as the knowledge grid, the health grid and e-governance grid \u2014 help make India a developed country? The idea is that the knowledge grid empowers the village citizens with skill and knowledge. The health grid brings the super-specialty healthcare that is available in the cities to the doorsteps of rural citizens. And the e-governance grid brings transparent governance to the citizens. All these grids lead to economic growth and social transformation.", "How can India become energy independent by 2030? Today fossil fuels dominate the energy sector throughout the world. The World Energy Forum predicts that in five to eight decades, the fossil fuels will run out because these sources of energy are not renewable. Also, energy costs will go up. Oil is already at $110 per barrel, and if this continues, this situation will be very tough to manage. So I set a goal of energy independence for my country. It\u2019s a three-dimensional approach. First, we should invest in solar power. Today solar power is not economical because the efficiency of solar cells is just 15% to 20%. So we should use CNT (carbon nano tubes) composites that can increase the efficiency of solar cells to 45% or 50%. Second, we should use nuclear energy, because India has abundant thorium based nuclear reactors. This is definitely a clean solution to energy needs. The third focus area should be bio-fuels, including ethanol as well as bio diesel made from jatropha [a plant that grows in wastelands] and algae. These three initiatives can free India from dependence on fossil fuels. It will also help maintain a clean environment.", "In your vision for India 2020, you envisaged that differences between the urban areas and the countryside would gradually disappear. Could you explain your concept of \u201cPURA\u201d and how that brings about this transformation? The concept of PURA \u2014 which stands for \u201cProviding Urban amenities in Rural Areas\u201d \u2014 is about giving a cluster of villages physical, electronic and knowledge connectivity. The idea is to empower the villagers, so that economic connectivity can emerge. We planned about 7,000 PURAs for the country \u2014 including hill PURAs, coastal PURAs and plains PURAs. I believe that connectivity is the key to bridging the rural-urban divide. The core-competence of the village will enable the production of competitive products for national and international markets. This will lead to rural enterprises which will create jobs in villages and lead to a vibrant economy in India\u2019s hinterland. That is how prosperity will emerge in the rural environment.", "Could you give an example, from your own experience, of how leaders should manage failure? Let me tell you about my experience. In 1973 I became the project director of India\u2019s satellite launch vehicle program, commonly called the SLV-3. Our goal was to put India\u2019s \u201cRohini\u201d satellite into orbit by 1980. I was given funds and human resources \u2014 but was told clearly that by 1980 we had to launch the satellite into space. Thousands of people worked together in scientific and technical teams towards that goal. By 1979 \u2014 I think the month was August \u2014 we thought we were ready. As the project director, I went to the control center for the launch. At four minutes before the satellite launch, the computer began to go through the checklist of items that needed to be checked. One minute later, the computer program put the launch on hold; the display showed that some control components were not in order. My experts \u2014 I had four or five of them with me \u2014 told me not to worry; they had done their calculations and there was enough reserve fuel. So I bypassed the computer, switched to manual mode, and launched the rocket. In the first stage, everything worked fine. In the second stage, a problem developed. Instead of the satellite going into orbit, the whole rocket system plunged into the Bay of Bengal. It was a big failure.  That day, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, Prof. Satish Dhawan, had called a press conference. The launch was at 7:00 am, and the press conference \u2014 where journalists from around the world were present \u2014 was at 7:45 am at ISRO\u2019s satellite launch range in Sriharikota [in Andhra Pradesh in southern India]. Prof. Dhawan, the leader of the organization, conducted the press conference himself. He took responsibility for the failure \u2014 he said that the team had worked very hard, but that it needed more technological support. He assured the media that in another year, the team would definitely succeed. Now, I was the project director, and it was my failure, but instead, he took responsibility for the failure as chairman of the organization. The next year, in July 1980, we tried again to launch the satellite \u2014 and this time we succeeded. The whole nation was jubilant. Again, there was a press conference. Prof. Dhawan called me aside and told me, \u201cYou conduct the press conference today.\u201d I learned a very important lesson that day. When failure occurred, the leader of the organization owned that failure. When success came, he gave it to his team. The best management lesson I have learned did not come to me from reading a book; it came from that experience. Continuing further with the six traits, the fourth trait is that the leader should have the courage to make decisions. Fifth, the leader should have nobility in management. Every action of the leader should be transparent. And finally, the leader should work with integrity and succeed with integrity. All the traits apply especially to the President of a country. The President continuously must be in touch with the people. The Rashtrapati Bhavan [i.e., the presidential residence in New Delhi, India's equivalent of the White House] must become the people\u2019s residence. When I was President I travelled to every state, cutting across hills, deserts, and seas.

WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF YOUR RATHER DISTINGUISHED CAREER CULMINATING IN A BHARAT RATNA IN YOUR LIFETIME? My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, of the Dept. of Space, Professor Satish Dhawan , who succeeded him and Dr.Brahm Prakash , father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life. FOUR MILESTONES OF MY CAREER: FOUR MILESTONES OF MY CAREER ONE: ONE Twenty years I spent in ISRO. I was given the opportunity to be the project director for India\u2019s first satellite launch vehicle, SLV3 . The one that launched Rohini . These years played a very important role in my life of a scientist. SECOND After my ISRO years, I joined \u2018Defence Research & Development Organisation\u2019 (DRDO) and got a chance to be the part of India\u2019s guided missile program.  It was my second bliss when Agni met its mission requirements in 1994. THIRD: THIRD The Department of Atomic Energy and DRDO had this tremendous partnership in the recent nuclear tests, on May 11 and 13. This was the third bliss. The joy of participating with my team in these nuclear tests and proving to the world that India can make it, that we are no longer a developing nation but one of them .  It made me feel very proud as an Indian. FOURTH: FOURTH The fact that we have now developed for Agni a re-entry structure, for which we have developed this new material . A very light material called carbon-carbon. One day an orthopedic surgeon from Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences visited my laboratory. He lifted the material and found it so light that he took me to his hospital and showed me his patients. There were these little girls and boys with heavy metallic calipers weighing over three kilograms each, dragging their feet around. He said to me: Please remove the pain of my patients. In three weeks, we made these floor reaction orthosis 300-gram calipers and took them to the orthopedic center. The children didn\u2019t believe their eyes. From dragging around a three kg load on their legs, they could now move around! Their parents had tears in their eyes.", "Sir, when will India reach its epitome in space research?

I saw India attain her freedom in August 1947; I saw the economic ascent phase of India [beginning in] 1991. I have worked with visionaries like Prof. Vikram Sarabhai. I have seen the green revolution, the white revolution, and the telecom revolution; I have also seen the growth of information and communication technologies (ICT), as well as India\u2019s successes in the space program and self-sufficiency in strategic weaponry.

I worked for ISRO for about 20 years. My team and I worked to put India\u2019s first satellite into space. Then our team took up the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. These were youthful teams that worked with me, and they have gone on to take up much larger projects. These in turn have led to great value addition in areas such as technology, infrastructure and, above all, human resources. One of the important lessons I learned in the space and missile program was not just how to handle success but how to deal with failure. Wharton is in the management environment. I would like young people to understand how they should manage failure. In any project you take up, you will face problems. These problems should not become the captain of the project chief; the project chief should be the captain of the problems and defeat the problems.", "You were actively involved in India\u2019s nuclear weapons tests in 1998.

What leadership qualities does one need to lead a country as large, complex and chaotic as India? Well, I won\u2019t call India chaotic, because order comes from disorder. That is what is happening now. I was elected President of India \u2014 from 2002 to 2007 \u2014 through a well-structured election process. Any leadership \u2014 whether it is political leadership or leadership in technology \u2014 requires that the leader have six traits. What are these traits? First, the leader must have vision.

How can this be achieved? Firstly, the educational system should highlight the importance of entrepreneurship and prepare the students right from the college education to get oriented towards setting up of the enterprises which will provide them creativity, freedom and ability to generate wealth. Apart from entrepreneurship, the youth should have the spirit that \"we can do it\". Secondly, the banking system should provide venture capital right from every village level to the prospective entrepreneurs for undertaking new enterprises. Banks have to be proactive to support the innovative products for enabling wealth generation by young entrepreneurs by setting aside the \"conventional tangible asset syndrome\". Definitely this involves certain amount of calculated risks which can be eliminated by making an analysis of successful venture capital enterprises. Thirdly, there is a need to identify marketable products and enhancement of purchasing power among the people. This can come through the implementation of mega programmes such as PURA, Interlinking of Rivers, Infrastructural missions, Power missions and Tourism. Also genuine border trade can improve if we have a friendly border in all sectors. The universities should become a facilitator for creating this entrepreneurship scheme through the support of the banking system and the marketing system. This is one way of reducing the employment gap leading to upliftment of the 260 million people living below the poverty line.", "Being a person of such caliber as to have achieved more than one can dream of in a life time, we are going to ask you a very difficult question.

It is true I was happy in 1980 when my team put the satellite in the orbit, India's first satellite. It is true in 1989, I was elated when my team succeeded in launching AGNI IRBM and it reached its target. In 1998 when India became a nuclear weapon state that also gave me more happiness. There is something above happiness that is when the material developed for AGNI was used for making Field Reaction Orthosis (FROs) and when a child walked with a 300 gm FRO in place of a 3kg and saw the tears of joy from her parents.

In this connection I would like to narrate the improvement of Kali Bein rivulet, the place where Gurunanak Devji is said to have received enlightenment. Over the years this rivulet has turned into weed choked drain. Recently river is clean due to the efforts of Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal in partnership with the Punjab State Government. From the discussions, I understand that he organized people?s participation in stopping the massive flow of sewage into the Bein and cleaned 160 km long polluted and choked rivulet within the last five years by deploying on an average 3000 volunteer pilgrims per day.

As I have been stressing on all forums, every young student of the country should teach atleast 10 persons how to read and write. This will make our nation's other 37% of population also literate very soon. Many Governmental and Non governmental organizations are also working with special emphasis at the level of pre-school and primary education to prevent school dropouts.", "The farmer?s suicides in Andhra Pradesh are taking place due to poor cottonseeds and this is due to laxity in our seed law policy. The companies producing the spurious seeds are not being fined adequately. At least there should be a stringent law. This is a good suggestion. Our senior bureaucrats should take it up. Quality control of seeds is important as well as the right time of seeding. Government should check spurious items.", "HOME WORK SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TI THE STUDENTS.WILL THERE BE A POLICY CHANGE IN THE EDUCATION POLICY TO ACHIEVE THIS I believe the home work is part of education. It improves the working habit of the student. Personally it has helped me.", "Don?t you think that teachers should get better pay for financial security?

If youth can undertake this task I am sure the entire country will become righteous and India will be a developed nation very soon.", "How do you get back to zero level now? India can live without nuclear weapons. That's our dream, and it should be the dream of the U.S. also. Under the START II treaty, the nuclear arsenals on each side have been reduced to around 3,000 weapons. I asked a top U.S. defense official when it'll come down to zero. He said it won't, it's just a dream. That means the so-called nuclear weapons states want to perpetuate their nuclear weapons status. What's the alternative for India then, especially when two neighbors are armed with nuclear weapons? Still, our Prime Minister has announced, \"You go to zero level, we are with you.\"", "Is there a danger of a nuclear arms race on the subcontinent? I'm not an expert on the arms race.

I write poetry, I started learning the veena, a beautiful instrument. One day I'll play a concert so that I can make people happy. These days you have to make people happy around you [laughs].", "What did you feel at the time of independence, when there were riots in India and the subcontinent was partitioned? I was in high school when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled India's flag in New Delhi. What I still remember is that the next morning there were two photographs on the front page of the newspaper--one of Nehru unfurling the flag, and the other showing Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, walking in Noakhali in Bengal, because of the communal riots there. You would normally expect the Father of the Nation to be at the flag-hoisting in the capital, but no, he was far away, removing the pain of the people. That taught me something about our culture that no university education could have.", "What did India achieve with the nuclear tests in May? The tests are the culmination of the development of nuclear technology in India, leading to nuclear weaponization. The tests were the result of many years of work by our nuclear scientists and defense technologists. They have generated a very important data base on the fission device as well as the fusion system. Today, India is a nuclear weapons state.", "But why did India need to go for nuclear weapons? We gave out three signals. In 1950, Nehru told the United Nations that the U.S. and the then Soviet Union should get rid of their nuclear weapons, go down to zero level. What happened? Both countries accumulated nuclear weapons, from dozens in the 1950s to thousands in 1974. We sent another signal by having a peaceful nuclear test in 1974. What happened then? By the 1990s the figure had reached 20,000 nuclear weapons. And there was proliferation. From one side to China, from the other side to Europe. And it didn't stop there. It even came to Pakistan. So two of our neighbors had nuclear weapons. In such a situation, we didn't have an alternative. For national security reasons, we had to explode nuclear devices.", "But you write in your book that you almost resigned. Almost. Because the judiciary believed I took the decision sitting in Moscow, unaware that I was receiving up-to-the-minute information. They found fault with the governor, so I felt I should resign.

Corruption is a continuous process (laughs). There is no doubt that Anna (Hazare) is fighting for an important cause. But if the Lokpal bill is passed, it will just serve to fill up all our jails. Instead, I propose another movement for the youth (below 35) called 'What can I give'. It has just three components: Make your mother happy, make your father free from corruption and work towards saving the environment by planting trees.

Today 20 million Indians are working in different parts of the world. They have taken up a profession and are contributing for the well-being of the nation where they are working. In short I can say, with a one billion population movement of 20 million is not big number. India is producing every year more than 300 thousand scientists, engineers, and medical professionals. Out of this, few thousands go out every year for seeking employment and higher education in different countries. These young people wherever they go they are bound by the umbilical relationship with the family and they share the knowledge and wealth. In such as situation, we should not be concerned by this movement. At the same time, it is important for India to build R&amp;D establishments - so that our own scientists working in institutions abroad can come back and work in our laboratories.

Where were you on that particular day? How did people react in the streets? How did they celebrate the sudden freedom of India from the centuries old bondage of British rule? Well, it\u2019s a beautiful question. I was born in the small island town of Rameshwaram where I completed my primary school education in the Panchayat school. I went to a slightly bigger town 40 minutes away from Rameshwaram, for my high school studies. At that time only the great event took place for the nation. My teacher, Reverend Teri Solomon, told all of our class boys that they must attend the midnight celebration on 15th August 1947, in the quadrangle of the school. Since I was the school leader, I was asked to organize the assembly of all the students. As I recollect, two events got imprinted in my young mind.

What is the reality behind dream intuitions? There are two ways by which brains functions are classified. Once is the conscious part of the brain, and the other is the sub-conscious part of the brain, when a person is awake, both the conscious and sub-conscious are active. When a person is dead, both are in active. When a person is sleeping, the conscious brain is at rest, while the sub-conscious mind is active and has been the cause of all dreams and intuitions. Nature is always symmetric. Hence this leads us to predict that there will be one more state, where the sub-conscious mind is at rest and the conscious mind is awake. This is the state which consumes the least amount of energy and our ancestors where pioneers in controlling the sub-conscious mind and this state is also called meditation. In sleep two kinds of sleep - rapid eye movement sleep (REM) 25%, NREM (non-REM sleep) 75%. REM sleep you get dreams, normally you get REM after midnight.

That is where our hope lies for the realisation of the Second Vision.\" In the 1960s and 1970s, students and youth took part in political movements with great enthusiasm - in the Nav Nirman movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan, for instance. But in the 1980s and 1990s students and youth did not take part in any such major movement and they do not seem to be interested in social and political issues and developments. Is this because the students have become grossly career-oriented? My view is that if you have a vision that India should become a developed country, it penetrates all minds. This urge to become a developed India is a vision that is greater than any group of people or any group of States. Everybody wants a vision driven by a mission and a goal. That is why we call it a second vision for the nation - of transforming India into a developed India. Once the vision comes, everybody feels that we have to be a developed India, a prosperous India. Then the tendency (on the part of the youth) of not participating in movements - it is because there is no programme that is greater than individuals or groups - will vanish. So, the vision is one of the biggest elements that will trigger young minds.", "But these MBTs have imported engines. At what stage is the development of the indigenous engine?

Because of the prevailing corruption, no one wants to join government organisations... Let me recount two recent events, one in Delhi and another one in south Orissa. I was talking to 400 children in Orissa. After my presentation, I asked them what will they do after 10+2. Many said they want to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, fashion designers, and social workers. One girl got up and said \"I want to become a political leader.\" Everybody laughed, you know. They said , \"Why do you want to become a political leader?\" I said there's nothing to laugh, at least she has a dream. Lets find out from her, why she wants to become a political leader. She said, \"to remove corruption.\" That is, you should not be frightened and run away from the problem.  In Delhi recently, in Vigyan Bhavan, I was addressing 200 children. The same question came up - \"what do you want to be\"? I want to be an astronaut and all those things, they said. One boy said, \"I want to join the IAS\". He said he wanted to remove corruption. Please write: \"In life, whether while studying or during your professional career, you may encounter problems. Problems should not become your master. (Pauses). You should become the master and defeat the problem\".", "Why is it that in our country, people who raise their voice against corruption meet a fateful end? Satyadev Dubey, to quote a recent example. I have talked about it recently in the 200th session of Rajya Sabha, I've clearly indicated that the freedom to think, the freedom to perform, excel, all is engrained in these three stages of freedom - it is very vital. And also, our constitution permits any person to have the right to perform. There should not be any hurdle for them.  In my personal view, for corruption you can put any number of laws, we cannot do anything. Only three people can do something for corruption, i.e., father, mother, and elementary school teacher. When the child is growing, only they can plant the best of thoughts, the best of character. If it done before the age of 20 years, no one can change it. Once a teacher said, \"If you give me a student, a child, for 7 years I will teach him and no god or devil can change him. So my feeling is, a corruption-free world has to start in the home. Because then you have a role model. That's why we have to see that we have very good role models - teachers. A good teacher leads a perfect noble life.", "If something is done, then it would definitely do a lot to boost the confidence of the people who want to fight corruption. No, what I want to do is, you must realise, we are a nation of a billion people, and a professor from USA asked me, \"Mr. Kalam, what is the core competence of India?\" Now tell me what would you say? Suppose someone would ask you this? My answer was, we are a nation of a billion people with multi-cultural, multi-religious, with many languages, what can be our core competence? We have got freedom since 1947. We are democratic since then. We have proved to the world - our core competency is managing and giving leadership to brilliant democratic people. Imagine how your college principal or director manages your college. Nobody else has got an experience of managing a billion people. We have many problems -  who cannot have problems? An aircraft is there. It takes off. Aircraft generates lift that's why it takes off. Drag also comes in. Suppose you make drag zero, then the aircraft will not fly.

Thermal plants do use significant quantity of water for their boiler and cooling operations. However, a large amount of the water use can be recycled and even be used to create aqua eco zones near the plants. I came across such eco zones at the nuclear power station at Kudankulam which attracts many varieties of birds. Thermal plants emit green houses gases which lead to global warming. Every kilogram of coal burned to generate power also leads to emission of about 2.7 kgs of carbon-di-oxide.", "What is Science and Technology in your view?

They can get prices of commodity so that they can sell their product at competitive price. The fishermen can get information on spool of fish through resource mapping data. Progressive use of such information will make an impact on the economic upliftment. For full poverty alleviation, it needs to multi-pronged approach and proper connectivities.", "Man is progressing fast in Science and Technology but simultaneously he is losing faith in God. Do you think it is a hindrance in path of progress? Science and technology is progressing fast. Most of the people who have excelled in science are believers of God.

Why rivers are not nationalized? When India attained Independence, its founders decided that some subjects would be responsibility of State and some of the Central Government. Water was and continues to be a State subject. World over, rapid population growth and climatic change is resulting in water scarcity in all regions. India is no exception.

I would like to know if its possible and if it is, is it safe? Irradiation for food items for their preservation is a proven technology world wide. Irradiation of food items work by disrupting the biological processes that lead to decay. In their interaction with water and other molecules that make up food and living organisms, radiation energy is absorbed by the molecules they contact. The reactions with the DNA cause the death of micro-organisms and insects and impair the ability of potatoes and onions to sprout. In India, BARC and DAE have capabilities for irradiating the food. They have established certain facilities for potatoes and onions.

In short I can say, with a one billion population movement of 20 million is not big number. India is producing every year more than 300 thousand scientists, engineers, and medical professionals. Out of this, few thousands go out every year for seeking employment and higher education in different countries. These young people wherever they go they are bound by the umbilical relationship with the family and they share the knowledge and wealth.

Third, just like every family asks the government for an economically developed nation; every family has the responsibility to give a great citizen to the nation. We have 200 million families.

Modern education system should also provide value based education to create enlightened citizens.", "Why are we ducking away from giving good strong moral education to students right from class V to College level. I think this is where we are lacking in comparison to Japan. If only we Indians could have been better morally, India would have been a differrent country. As you must be aware if same thing is told to someone day after day right through atleast 10 years of schooling, it will have atleast some impact on the person. Atleast it will cause a guilt feeling whenever he is doing something wrong. Right now we dont even bother to open the moral education books (if any at all) untill the examination day. Even Teachers are not serious about it.They will say \"Ok, Do your pending HomeWork quietly\". We need to work on moral as dilligently as possible.

A host of meritorious students of science are compelled to look for employment immediately on completion of higher education. Consequently, promising Scientist gravitate towards administrative and other non-scientific positions. I would like your comments on this please? There is continuous upgradation of infrastructural facilities in our Universities and Research and Development Laboratories. The cause of meritorious students seeking in administration and management is not purely due to non-availability of infrastructural facilities. Universities have to cultivate the habit of research and innovation among our students right from the early stages. This will lead to the prevention of science students migrating to other non-scientific areas.", "Can you please suggest some measure to groom our students into young Scientist which will help in avoiding brain drain? We should not be worried with some amount of brain drain taking place in the country. Our professional colleges are producing three hundred thousand engineers and the medical professionals every year. If 10% of them go out to different countries, we are not going to suffer. Their connectivity with families and their institutions will definitely enrich our working system.

This is already taking place in many of our laboratories.", "With global warming, it is feared that glaciers will melt and release water into the sea, thus increasing the sea level. Increase in the sea level would be disastrous in places like Bangladesh and in our own Sunderbans. Is there anything we can do to protect our shores? Global warming is no more a myth, it is a fact. Because of Global warming the average temperature of earth has risen by 0.6 degree Celsius in the last 50 years and snows / ice resources are very sensitive to the temperature changes. Apart from the Himalayan Glaciers, all the Glaciers including Ice sheet are receding. The mountain glacier will not affect substantially the sea level rise. But Ice Sheet Polar Ice Caps melt will definitely increase the sea level. And the other reason for increasing the sea level will be due to expansion of water by heating. That may inundate low-lying areas. Research is important to identify the vulnerable areas. Indian and international communities are working towards this direction.", "To the best of our understanding oceans contain enormous resources like variety of fishes, oil and natural gas etc. used as byproducts. In order to explore and exploit these resources what efforts have been made in India and where do we stand at international level? Nearly 50% of our oil and natural gas production is coming from off-shore drillings. Also, local requirement of fish is fully met and we export small quantity of fish to outside countries. We have to work determinedly to increase our fishing capabilities by going to deep water fishing using state-of-the art infrastructure.

Despondent, I left Dehradun and on the banks of the Ganga, I saw Swami Sivananda surrounded by thousands of devotees. I sat in the last row.

In your own assessment, do you consider Modi guilty of the Gujarat riots? I'm not there to pronounce a judgment on the Gujarat riots; that's the work of the judiciary. But I will narrate another incident about Vajpayee. When he took over the Cabinet, I was scientific adviser. He called me to his office one night and offered me a Cabinet post. I was busy with the Agni and nuclear programme. The next morning I went back to meet him. He sat in his room, surrounded by trays of sweets, which were a weakness of his. I told him I was sorry but I couldn't become a minister as my work on the two programmes would suffer. Later, I finished work on the programmes, left the government and went back to teaching. It was then that Vajpayee called me and asked me to become president.", "So why is it that the so-called Muslim leaders in the North always have the feeling that you are not a practising Muslim?

We cannot afford that what you can do about it? It is true that the cost of higher education particularly professional education has been constantly going up.

Two world leaders exclusively come to my mind -- Mahatma Gandhi and his unique life. Similarly, Nelson Mandela. I went to the prison where Mandela lived. Where there is righteousness in the heart, there is beauty in the character. That's the example of Mahatma Gandhi throughout his life. In 2006, I travelled in the same kind of train with a steam engine from Durban to Pietermaritzburg. I could imagine the courage which Gandhiji showed in that cold winter. Ahimsa dharma came after the battle of Kalinga. It transformed King Ashoka. The second time ahimsa dharma was put into action was by Mahatma Gandhi at Pietermaritzburg.

How close are we to achieving that vision, in view of that deadline being six years away? Actually India 2020 is a vision for an economically developed India by 2020. Up to 2008 our GDP was 8 to 9 per cent. Then there was a problem across the Atlantic Ocean, and our GDP crashed to 6 to 7 per cent, then to 5.5 and then to 5 per cent. So in the 2008-2014 period, we had a slack in our development programme. Six years is a long period in a nation like India with 600 million youth, nowhere in the democratic world there exists this strength. We also have a natural way of life. Our agriculture is doing well. We have 250 to 260 million tons of food. Our IT, small scale and pharma industries are doing very well. Of course, we have to do lots in the development of the rural area. We have 600,000 villages where 700 million people live. We have to Provide Urban Amenities to Rural Areas (PURA). Seven thousand PURAS are needed to lift 600,000 villages. Even now it is not too late. Fortunately, I understand the present government is taking a priority for PURAS.

No. There is nothing like that. As long as we declare ourselves a nuclear weapon state, that stands.

We missed the bus, in the case of Industrial Revolution too. In Tipu's time, the world's first war rocket was built and used. In the first battle, the British were defeated. In the second, Tipu was defeated. So we had the 'rocket sense'. We had the capability to make a rocket towards the end of the 18th century.

We have to catch the children very young and nurture them in the sports or athletics where they have aptitude and interest. Their career must be in the sports and nowhere else.
